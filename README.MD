# Automatic Medication Dispenser In Order To Reduce Medication Non-Adherence  

This project is an AI-powered automatic medication dispenser designed to improve medication adherence using a combination of image recognition, OCR, and natural language processing. The system is built for patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers to ensure safe and timely medication intake â€” all while being monitored remotely through a mobile app.

It integrates hardware control (Arduino), YOLO-based pill recognition, and a custom-trained spaCy NLP model to extract dosage and frequency instructions from prescription labels. A PyQt6 desktop interface manages the system on-device, and a mobile app enables remote supervision.

## ðŸŒŸ About the Project

This project presents an AI-powered automatic medication dispenser designed to improve medication adherence and safety for patients. Initially developed for the Massachusetts Science & Engineering Fair (MSEF), the device advanced to the State Level Finalist round, where it was recognized for its innovative integration of machine learning, computer vision, and IoT technologies in a healthcare setting.

**Core Features:**

 - Image recognition model to verify whether medication has been taken correctly.

 - OCR + NLP (Named Entity Recognition) to extract dosage instructions from prescription labels.

 - Arduino-controlled dispensing system triggered by AI verification and scheduled reminders.

 - Mobile + Desktop interface (via Toga framework) for caregiver monitoring and remote updates.

 - Video evidence recording for accountability and patient monitoring. 


**Goal:**
To create an accessible, intelligent system that ensures patients take the correct medications at the correct times â€” reducing errors, improving adherence, and offering peace of mind for caregivers and family members.

**Recognition:**  

 - Filed for a provisional patent for the design and idea December 2024 

 - Selected for the Massachusetts Science & Engineering Fair (MSEF) Regional Round

 - Advanced to the MSEF State Level Competition as a Finalist

 - Praised for its real-world impact, interdisciplinary approach, and scalable potential
