# Automatic Medication Dispenser In Order To Reduce Medication Non-Adherence  

This project is an AI-powered automatic medication dispenser designed to improve medication adherence using a combination of image recognition, OCR, and natural language processing. The system is built for patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers to ensure safe and timely medication intake â€” all while being monitored remotely through a mobile app.

It integrates hardware control (Arduino), YOLO-based pill recognition, and a custom-trained spaCy NLP model to extract dosage and frequency instructions from prescription labels. A PyQt6 desktop interface manages the system on-device, and a mobile app enables remote supervision.

## ðŸŒŸ About the Project

This project presents an AI-powered automatic medication dispenser designed to improve medication adherence and safety for patients. Initially developed for the Massachusetts Science & Engineering Fair (MSEF), the device advanced to the State Level Finalist round, where it was recognized for its innovative integration of machine learning, computer vision, and IoT technologies in a healthcare setting. 


**Goal:**

To create an accessible, intelligent system that ensures patients take the correct medications at the correct times â€” reducing errors, improving adherence, and offering peace of mind for caregivers and family members. 



**Core Features:**

 - Image recognition model to verify whether medication has been taken correctly.

 - OCR + NLP (Named Entity Recognition) to extract dosage instructions from prescription labels.

 - Arduino-controlled dispensing system triggered by AI verification and scheduled reminders.

 - Mobile + Desktop interface (via Toga framework) for caregiver monitoring and remote updates.

 - Video evidence recording for accountability and patient monitoring. 



**Recognition:**  

 - Filed for a provisional patent for the design and idea December 2024 

 - Selected for the Massachusetts Science & Engineering Fair (MSEF) Regional Round

 - Advanced to the MSEF State Level Competition as a Finalist

 - Praised for its real-world impact, interdisciplinary approach, and scalable potential

### ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Automated Pill Dispensing** 
  Dispenses the correct medication at the right time using an Arduino-controlled mechanism, reducing the risk of missed or incorrect doses.

- **Real-Time Pill Intake Monitoring** 
  Utilizes a YOLOv5-based image recognition system to track the sequence: pill present â†’ pill taken â†’ hand empty â€” confirming successful medication intake.

- **Custom OCR Processing** 
  Uses Tesseract OCR to extract medication names, dosages, and instructions from images of prescriptions or labels.

- **Medical NER Model** 
  A custom-trained spaCy Named Entity Recognition (NER) model processes OCR output to identify key medical information like dosage frequency and medication schedules.

- **Cross-Platform Interface (Toga + Buildozer)** 
  Built using the Toga framework for both desktop and mobile (Android and IOS) platforms, allowing caregivers and users to interact with the system easily.

- **Flask-Based Communication** 
  A lightweight Flask server connects the app to backend ML models, ensuring fast and reliable processing of user input and image recognition results.

- **Emergency Alert System** 
  If a user fails to take their medication within a set time frame, the system plays an audio alert and notifies a connected caregiver.

- **Time-Based Triggers** 
  The application runs on a schedule, automatically activating the camera and dispenser based on predefined medication times.

- **PDF Report Generation** 
  Extracted text from prescriptions is automatically saved and compiled into a downloadable PDF for easy recordkeeping and sharing with healthcare providers.
